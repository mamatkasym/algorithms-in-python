"""
We are given the natural numbers n and k. All natural numbers from 1 to n are written in a circle.
First, count the k-th number starting from the first one and delete it.
Then k numbers are counted starting from the next one and the k-th one is removed again, and so on.
The process stops when one number remains. It is required to find the last number.
